/// # Arguments
/// * `entries` - Serialized `ChangelogEntry` bytes, one per change in the chunk
/// * `range` - The FastForwardRange identifying the range of changes
/// * `pruned_tree_bytes` - Postcard-serialized `PrunedMerkleTree` covering all changes
/// * `start_change_id` - The absolute change ID of the first change in this batch
///   (0 for the first proof, `previous_io.end_change_id` for subsequent proofs)
/// * `sigref_map` - Per-user sigref state, threaded across recursive chunks
/// * `recent_roots` - Sliding window of recent `(change_id, root)` pairs, used
///   to validate each entry's `parent_clc`. Threaded across recursive chunks.
///   For first chunks (`start_change_id == 0`), the caller passes an empty
///   `Vec` and the guest seeds with `(0, start_clc_state.root)`. For
///   extension chunks, the caller passes `previous_io.recent_roots`, whose
///   last entry must be `(start_change_id, start_clc_state.root)`.
/// * `timestamp_hwm` - Timestamp high-water mark threaded across recursive chunks.
